  <h3><b>Abstract:</b></h3>
<p>RISC-V is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA) that began in 2010 and is based on established reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles. Unlike most other ISA designs, RISC-V is provided under open source licenses that do not require fees to use. A number of companies are offering or have announced RISC-V hardware, open-source operating systems with RISC-V support are available, and the instruction set is supported in several popular software toolchains.</p>
  <h3><b>Synopsis:</b></h3>
  <p>We try to simulate the operations of RISC-V using a simulator built using javascript.
Each line of the code was taken as an input in the form of a string and then stored in an array. Then each of the lines was processed separately using the code written in javascript with the help of functions and if-else statement(s). We then hoisted the website using Github.</p>
